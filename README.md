# A-U-NET-Based-Audio-Denoiser
Noise reduction is a crucial problem in the field of audio processing, as it significantly impacts the quality and intelligibility of sound signals. In this project, we propose a novel approach based on the U-Net architecture to tackle sound noise reduction efficiently. The U-Net is a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks, and we adapt it to handle the challenges posed by audio denoising. The introduction of the project provides an overview of the significance of noise reduction in audio processing and the growing interest in leveraging deep learning techniques for this purpose. We highlight the drawbacks of traditional methods, which often struggle to effectively remove noise while preserving the original audio content.
